      At Dropbox, I paired with another product designer to help announce Dropbox's new plan and pricing updates to its existing customers. Launched in Spring 2019, our in-product announcement flow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Explains to customers how their plan's price was increasing along with its
        features
      </li>
      <li>
        Educates customers on what the new features are
      </li>
      <li>
        Gives people ways to change or cancel their plan
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
