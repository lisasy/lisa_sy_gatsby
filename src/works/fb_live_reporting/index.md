#  In Spring 2016, I led product design to improve Facebook's reporting platform so that people can flag inappropriate, sensitive content streaming on Live Videos.

### This allowed Facebook to intake 574% more reports and remove 157% more objectionable content than previously. This enables Facebook to become a safer platform for people to be their authentic selves.

## People are struggling to get their voice heard.
When they see inappropriate content on Facebook, they can report it to get
it removed. However, there were ample problems  with our existing reporting
flow, making it challenging for people to iscover, express their problem, and
find the help they needed.

          Our users' goals
        </h2>
        <p>
          When people use the reporting flow, they’re trying to accomplish some key
          jobs-to-be-done, including:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Protect other people from seeing this on Facebook. (37%*)
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell Facebook that I don’t want to see things like this again. (21%)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I reframed these JTBDs as opportunities for us to take on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How might we help people protect others from seeing objectionable,
            sensitive content on Facebook?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we help people tell us that they’re seeing things that they
    don’t like?
          </li>

      These prompts helped kick off a design sprint with where I led my team
      from aligning on these problems, generating and exploring concepts, then
      validating them with real users — within three weeks. Here’s what that looked
      like.

        Responding to those two prompts, I began sketching end-to-end user flows
  to bring our collective vision to reality. The goal of this exercise was to get
  all of the various ideas out of our system, so that we can see what types of
  concepts could succeed the most. We began asking ourselves some critical
  questions, like:
      </p>
      <h2>
        What if reporting leaned into helping people protect their others from
  seeing inappropriate content, and it was about ease and efficiency?
      </h2>

        I worked in process, zooming in and out of my explorations to discover,

  confidence in. These are explorations of user flows:

    <h2>What we learned from user research</h2>
    <p>
      When we brought these two concepts into usability testing with seven
participants, we found that people preferred the one-click reporting concept to
the other one. This informed us that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      People intend to “report” or to “hide” something for different reasons,
and it’s going to be rather personal.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the multiple tags UI components, people felt more empowered to tell
us with greater nuance about their issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These learnings gave us confidence moving ahead to ship this new reporting
flow on Facebook.

    <h2>Results and outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      We used these learnings to launch this reporting flow two months later for
Live Videos, before expanding it to be application beyond all media content on
Facebook, like normal videos, photos, and posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allowed Facebook to <strong>intake 574% more reports and
      remove 157% more objectionable content than previously</strong>.
