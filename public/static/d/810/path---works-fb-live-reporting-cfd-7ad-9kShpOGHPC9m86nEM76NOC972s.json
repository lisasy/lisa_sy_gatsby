I conceived, coordinated, designed, executed,\n      and ship a product resulting in higher report volumes of objectionable\n      content that our Community Operations organization was able to remove\n      (with a 39.7% form completion compared to 3.11% previously.).

The existing reporting flow wasn't\n      efficient nor ideal in meeting users' needs. Furthermore, it was built\n      on a legacy code base constrained making meaningful iterative design and engineering changes.\n      Furthermore, it was a product that many cross-functional teams had much\n      stake and voice in, such as the Policy, Communications, and Community\n      Operations teams.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Through ample user research, our team highlighted that these were the\n      core needs and expectations that people have been they encounter a\n      problem on Facebook.
